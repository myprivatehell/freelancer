description: My Private Hell's crushing self-titled debut is a four-song EP that captures the essence of love, loss and triumphs during a time of injustice, racism and police brutality. The EP was recorded at NRG studios in North Hollywood, helmed by sound engineer Josh Newell. The original is truly still, My Private Hell's best work.<br /><br /><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/my-private-hell-ep/1519649786">Purchase Now</a><br /><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/my-private-hell-ep/1519649786"></iframe>
