Suicide EP
Self-Released
2009

With the June 9th, 2009 release of the “Suicide EP,” My Private Hell’s second EP in a 4 year span, critics and fans will experience a band that has come a long way since 2005’s impressive EP ’Weight Of the World.’ Now in their 5th year together, Gian Erguiza, Blue Palacol and Eric Cuarez, My Private Hell has taken their music to new places while retaining the core values they’ve always embodied and embraced since their inception. Needless to say, the band is coming into their own on their latest EP.

"......My Private Hell, though having modern tones, are not another modern American metal band with unintelligible harsh, screaming vocals, an emphasis on constant riffing, and the usual simple blast beats. Gian's vocals are clear and clean, and he can actually play an inspiring guitar solo. Also their arrangements show variation in pace and style, as on 'Temptation' and 'I'm Alive,' that could lend them a progressive label in time....."
