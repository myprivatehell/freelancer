description: With the June 9th, 2009 release of the “Suicide EP,” My Private Hell’s second EP in a 4 year span, critics and fans will experience a band that has come a long way since 2005’s most impressive debut EP. My Private Hell took their music to new heights while retaining the core value they’ve always embodied and embraced since their inception, which is to create music to inspire people to fuel their creativity, push originality, find their uniqueness and stand up for what's right. If the first EP focused on the bands brutal, unforgiving sound, the Suicide EP focuses on the bands musical experimentation and expansion. Stand out tracks include Suicide, Temptation and SVD.
