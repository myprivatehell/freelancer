description: With the June 9th, 2009 release of the “Suicide EP,” My Private Hell’s second EP showed the critics and fans how much the band has come since the release of their impressive debut EP, which was released in 2005. My Private Hell took their music to new heights while retaining the core value the band has always embodied and embraced since their inception, which is to create music to inspire people to find their uniqueness, path to creativity, love but stand up for what's right, fight injustice, racism, prejudice and police brutality. If the first EP focused on the bands brutal, unforgiving sound, the Suicide EP focuses on the bands musical experimentation and expansion. Stand out tracks include Suicide, Temptation and SVD.
