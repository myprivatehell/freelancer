The number of blacks being killed by white police is completely out of control. We stand in solidarity with the #BlackLivesMatter movement and promise to join the fight
                    as the time is now for change, now matter how ugly it may get. No justice, no peace. You are either on this side or the other and now is the time to choose. My Private Hell does not support or condone systemic racism and our music is a symbol and war cry against it. </p>

                    Resissue, reissue, reissue. Yes, we are reissuing the work that we previously did because we realized that the universe was trying to tell us that we need to create awareness of the musical work that we have done in the past. Upon realizing that the 
                    band never got to really enjoy the fruits of the online world, doesn't mean the music should go into oblivion. So we are deciding to once again put our music out into the world. For whatever purpose it may be, we hope you find hope, life and power in our music to help you fight all of the injustices in your world.</p>
