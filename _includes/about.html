                    <p>In December of 2004, four friends decided to change the way they were living their lives forever by forming a band and creating rock/metal music without limitations regardless of genre or style. They picked up their
instruments, got to work and went on a whirlwind campaign that lasted for years in which the band ultimately fulfilled what they came to do. Disrupt the scene, create musical awareness and make their mark on the scene. In the end, the band was left
                 with three members who eventually joined and formed other bands in the wake of My Private Hell's hiatus. But truth be told, never say never and never say die.</p>

                    <p>Their original EP includes the powerhouse "Barrys Song," a track specifically dedicated to a slain friend and the all encompassing "Confession," which were open thoughts about an ex-loved one. The Suicide Ep also boasted two standout tracks in 
                     "Suicide" and the thought-provoking, but damning reality of an addict trying to stay clean in "Temptation." My Private Hell was based out of Los Angeles and heavily expressed strong convictions about everyday struggles of life and all of the different elements we have to factor in to survive. </p>
